<p>I proposed an algorithm that recognizes actions and creates visualizations using <a target="_blank" href ="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect">Kinect</a> and <a target="_blank" href ="http://www.ros.org">ROS</a>. </p>
<p>To achieve action recognition, I extracted the positions of every joint in a moving human body from the data stream and created a predictive model of the personâ€™s behavior in ROS.</p>

<p>Additionally, I also implemented various functions such as: blurring the face of a person in color images; isolating movements of only a part of the body; creating video based on playback of Kinect-extracted real-time screenshots.</p>
